# 🚀 Nelson Avilés — Data Science Portafolio

Hi! I’m an **Industrial Civil Engineer** (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, 2024) turned **Data Scientist & Business Intelligence Analyst**. I thrive on turning messy data into clear business value, automating decisions, and telling stories with numbers—especially in **fintech, mining, and operations**.

## 🧭 Methodology & Values

- **CRISP-DM first**: Business understanding → Data understanding → Modelling → Evaluation → Deployment.  
- **Reproducibility matters**: version-controlled notebooks & `requirements.txt` for every project.  
- **Explainability counts**: SHAP, feature importance, and clear visual storytelling.  
- **Stakeholder-centric dashboards**: interactive BI that cuts reporting time by ≥ 80 %.
